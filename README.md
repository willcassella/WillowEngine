Willow Engine is a game engine in development by Will Cassella.
For a summary of the layout of the engine, please see "Architecture.txt" in the Documentation directory.

Note: While most of the engine is compilable and functional, some parts do not compile on any platforms; particularily the "GLRender" service. The rest of the engine is undergoing refactoring, and that module has not been updated to match new API.
