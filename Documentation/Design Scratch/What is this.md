# Design Scratch

This is a folder where I save (some) of my scratch notes while working on the engine. These notes may be outdated, incomplete, incorrect, contradictory, or completely incomprehensible. 

However, one thing I've always found interesting is reading about how specific projects evolved as different constraints were discovered or applied, and how they might have changed had those constraints been different. These notes might be of interest to anyone who's curious on how that applies to this project, at least until I can put time into writing a more complete report on the subject.
